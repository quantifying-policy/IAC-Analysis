# Tracing Trends in the Space Sector
Natural Language Processing on Abstracts submitted to a Space Conference


I work in the space sector and I'd like to get a better understanding of the current trends and data. One of the premier conferences of the sector is the International Astronautical Congress (IAC). It takes place annually in a different country. It is an exciting combination of an academic conference with presentations and submitted papers, officials of space agencies, and industry showcasing the latest rocket engines. All space related topics - policy, engineering, science - are discussed. These characteristics make the IAC an apt magnifier to see the developments of the space community at large.

The basic source of information is the IAC library, where abstracts of papers submitted to the conference are found. I parse the abstracts of the past five years (2018-2022) in Step 1 and pre-process the raw data in Step 2. In Step 3, I develop a machine-learning model to classify the abstracts into some 100 distinct categories. I bring all this information together in Step 4. Finally, I explore the data through visuals in Step 5 and present my findings, conclusions, and some limitations. Feel free to skip to "5. Exploitation and Analysis" if you can't wait to learn about the space sector.
